# Gnosis Protocol subgraph

<img align="right" width="350" src="./docs/subgraph.png">

Implements a subgraph for the [Gnosis Protocol](https://github.com/gnosis/dex-contracts)

- [Subgraph in Mainnet](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/gnosis/protocol)
- [Subgraph in Rinkeby](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/gnosis/protocol-rinkeby)

## Setup environment

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Create your own environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and setup your own config

## Setup for local development

> First setup environment (see above)

1. Run a local ganache-cli and migrate the dependencies
   > TODO: Initially this step was done in the same project, but there's a dependency issue to solve in dex-contracts. It's better for now cloning dex-contracts and migrating separatelly

```bash
# Run a local ganache in one tab
# Make sure your node version is `v12.*`, as `v14.*` is not yet supported by ganache
yarn run-ganache

# Clone dex-liquidity-provision project (in another tab)
#   It doesn't matter where you clone the project, this project is independent from dex-subgraph
git clone https://github.com/gnosis/dex-liquidity-provision

# In order to generate even more data (esp withdraws and cancelations), clone the following project
#   It doesn't matter where you clone the project, this project is independent from dex-subgraph
git clone https://github.com/gnosis/dex-contracts


# Migrate dependencies (in another tab)
cd dex-liquidity-provision
yarn
yarn build && npx truffle migrate

# Setup some test data
npx truffle exec ./node_modules/@gnosis.pm/dex-contracts/build/common/scripts/ganache/setup_thegraph_data.js
npx truffle exec scripts/testing/setup_thegraph_data.js# Setup some test data
```

2. Run a local The Graph Node

```bash
# Clone The Graph node
git clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/
cd graph-node/docker

# [only Linux] Inject host IP in docker-compose.yml
# You might need to run it as `root`
./setup.sh

# Start a local Graph Node
# If you ran `./setup.sh` as `root`, you'll need to do that here too
docker-compose up
```

3. In dex-subgraph. Create a local subgraph:

```bash
# Create a new subgraph
yarn create-ganache

# Deploy it
yarn deploy
```

The subgraph should be accessible in: http://127.0.0.1:8000/subgraphs/name/gnosis/protocol/graphql

<details><summary>Example of GraphQL subscription to try:</summary>

```graphql
subscription UserData {
  users {
    id

    orders {
      id
      orderId
      owner {
        id
      }
      buyToken {
        id
        address
        name
        symbol
      }
      sellToken {
        id
        address
        name
        symbol
      }
      txHash
      txLogIndex
    }

    deposits {
      id
      tokenAddress
      amount
      txHash
    }

    withdrawals {
      tokenAddress
      txHash
    }

    withdrawRequests {
      tokenAddress
      txHash
    }
  }
}
```

or

```
subscription UserData {

    fleetDeployeds {id, fleet}

}
```

## Update to a new version of the contracts

> First setup for local development (see above)

1. Make sure you use the latest version of `dex-contracts`

```bash
# See all available versions in: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnosis.pm/dex-contracts
npm ls @gnosis.pm/dex-contracts
```

2. Update the ABI

```bash
# Install new version of dex-contracts
yarn add @gnosis.pm/dex-contracts@<new-version> --save

# Update ABI
yarn abi
```

3. Make sure the addresses are updated

```bash
# Show the addresses for all the networks
yarn addresses

# Update the addresses and the start block
vim config/ganache.json
vim config/rinkeby.json
vim config/mainnet.json
```

4. Review the differences between the two version in the contract, and adapt all the handlers.

5) Regenerate the model:

```bash
yarn gen
```

## Deploy to rinkeby or mainnet

> First update the version of dex-contracts if it's not up to date

Deploy to the different networks:

```bash
# Make sure you are authenticated
graph auth https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ <your-access-token>

# Deploy to rinkeby
yarn deploy-rinkeby

# Deploy to staging
yarn deploy-staging

# Deploy to mainnet
#   IMPORTANT: Make sure the graph is well tested in staging environment
yarn deploy-mainnet
```

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Delete all containers and data
docker-compose down && rm -rf data

# Run the graph
docker-compose up
```
