#   - Bytes: Byte array, represented as a hexadecimal string. Commonly used for Ethereum hashes and addresses
#   - ID:	Stored as a string
#   - string: Scalar for string values
#   - boolean: Scalar for boolean values
#   - Int	The GraphQL spec defines Int to have size of 32 bytes
#   - BigInt	Arbitrarily large integers. Used for Ethereum's uint32, int64, uint64, ..., uint256 types. Note: Everything below uint32, such as int32, uint24 or int8 is represented as i32.
#   - BigDecimal	BigDecimal is used to represent arbitrary precision decimals
