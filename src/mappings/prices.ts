/**
  The price in the contract is recorded in an internal format that would be something like:
        "OWL weis" / "1e18 Token weis"
    ... or in other words:
        "OWL weis" / "exa Token weis"

  Yes it's confusing, but keep reading to understand what it means, and the reason why.
         
  Our objective is to calculate the price in a user friendly format.
  The format we want is "number of OWLs per unit of Token": OWL / Token
  
  So we want a price that, for example in WETH-OWL market, 150 would mean:
    - The units in scientific notation are OWL/WETH
    - It would mean 150 OWLs is the price of 1 WETH
    - Informally, people would say, the price of the token is "150 OWL"
    - WETH is the base token
    - OWL is the quote token

  i.e. For USDC wich has 6 decimals if the contract returns 980942729992317873036301363769:
    - It would mean 980942729992317873036301363769 "weis of owl for each 1e18 weis of USDC"
    - In other words 980942729992317873036301363769 "OWL weis / exa USDC weis"  
    - Indeed, it's confusing, however it's the way the contract stores the price, for 2 reasons:
        - 1) To avoid dealing with decimals simplify it's logic (this is why prices and amounts are always in wei)
        - 2) The 1e18 (or exa) is just to be able to give a more accurate price, so instead of saving the 
             price for 1 wei (that could be potentially to small), it saves the price of a lot of weis (1e18 --> exa)
        - To understand better why exa is used, let's see two examples:
            * What is the price of an egg? Probably no-one would ask that, and he would ask for the price of a dozen
            * A bit more extreme. What's the mass of an atom? Instead of calculating the mass of a single atom, we 
              express the values for a huge number of them; 1.66 * 1e27 (Avogadro number) 
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass
    - Now that we understand the reasoning. Let's explain how we go from that number to units.
      For that we will explain it using scientific notation, and going backwards:

          980942729992317873036301363769 * <something> = 0.98094273 OWL/USDC
            --> <something> = 1e-30
      Okay, so:
        [price * 1e-30 ] OWL / USDC
        [price * 1e-18 * 1e-18 * 1e6 ] OWL / USDC
        [price * 1e-18 * 1e-18  ] OWL / USDC * 1e-6
        [price * 1e-18 * 1e-18] OWL / USDC wei
        [price * 1e-18] OWL / 1e18 * USDC wei
        [price * 1e-18] OWL / exa USDC wei
        [price] OWL * 1e-18 / exa USDC wei
        [price] OWL wei / exa USDC wei
